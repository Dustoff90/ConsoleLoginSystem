# ConsoleLoginSystem
This a console based Login system, download the Usernames.txt and Passwords.txt to store data or create the .txts in a path you're running the code in.
(In the process of fixing data reading, problems with entering a username that doesn't exist and entering a password that does and still logging in vise versa)
